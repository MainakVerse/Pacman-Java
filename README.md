      <h2>ABOUT</h2>
      <p>Pac-Man, originally named Puck Man in Japan, is an arcade maze video game developed by Namco and first released in 1980. In the game, players control Pac-Man, a yellow character, through a maze, with the objective of eating all the dots while avoiding four colored ghosts: Blinky (red), Pinky (pink), Inky (cyan), and Clyde (orange). Eating large flashing dots, known as "power pellets," allows Pac-Man to eat the ghosts for bonus points while they are temporarily blue. Completing a level involves eating all the dots, after which the player advances to the next level.</p>

   <h2>INVENTOR & HISTORY</h2>
   <p>Game development began in early 1979, led by Toru Iwatani with a nine-man team. Iwatani sought to create a game appealing to both women and men, diverging from the masculine themes common in video games at the time. The inspiration for Pac-Man's character came from the image of a pizza with a slice missing, and the Japanese word "kuchi" (mouth). The game's original Japanese title, "Puck Man," was derived from the phrase "paku paku taberu," which means to gobble something up. The title was changed to "Pac-Man" for its North American release to prevent vandalism.</p>

   <h2>ALGORITHM</h2>
   <p>Each of the four ghosts in Pac-Man has its own unique artificial intelligence (A.I.). Blinky directly chases Pac-Man, while Pinky and Inky try to position themselves in front of Pac-Man. Clyde alternates between chasing and fleeing from Pac-Man. An algorithm dictates the movements of the ghosts as they pursue Pac-Man.</p>
