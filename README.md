      <h2>ABOUT</h2>
      <p>Pac-Man, originally named Puck Man in Japan, is an arcade maze video game developed by Namco and first released in 1980. In the game, players control Pac-Man, a yellow character, through a maze, with the objective of eating all the dots while avoiding four colored ghosts: Blinky (red), Pinky (pink), Inky (cyan), and Clyde (orange). Eating large flashing dots, known as "power pellets," allows Pac-Man to eat the ghosts for bonus points while they are temporarily blue. Completing a level involves eating all the dots, after which the player advances to the next level.</p>
